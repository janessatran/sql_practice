/*
Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table seat storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.

The column id is continuous increment.
Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.
Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?

+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
For the sample input, the output is:
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
	CASE
		WHEN seat.id % 2 <> 0 AND seat.id = (SELECT MAX(seat.id) FROM seat) THEN seat.id
		WHEN seat.id % 2 = 0 THEN seat.id - 1
		ELSE
			seat.id + 1
	END as id,
	student 
FROM seat
ORDER BY id
;
